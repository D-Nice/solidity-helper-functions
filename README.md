# solidity-helper-functions
A collection of solidity helper functions meant to make DApp development even easier. 

I will initially be adding some of my own, with descriptions of what they are intended for. If you would like to add your own, please fork the repo and make a pull request. Please properly comment your code.

The most integral helper function currently within this colleciton, is the safeSend function, which is intended to ensure that your DApp can interact with wallet contracts and other contracts.
